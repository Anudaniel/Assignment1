    <p> <h2>What is HTML to me?</h2>
         <h5>
        HTML which is HyperText Markup Language is a language used in creation of web pages for the internet. It is the foremost and very important part of the creation of web pages.
        It has different <em>elements, tags</em> and <em>attributes</em> which are used to give it more profound meaning and use for different purposes.
